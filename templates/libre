<h1>Otter - Online TableTop Environment Renderer</h1>
<p>
  This server is running Otter, the Online TableTop Environment
  Renderer.
<p>
  Otter is Free Software, according to the <a href="AGPLv3">GNU Affero General
  Public License, version 3</a> or (at your option) any later version.
  There is NO WARRANTY.
<p>
  You can download <a href="/_/src/">source code for this running server
  version</a>.  That includes the source code for all the included
  game piece pictures (shape libraries).
<p>
  The shape libraries have a variety of licences.
  All those included with Otter are available under at least
  <a href="CC-BY-SA-3.0">CC-BY-SA 3.0</a> or
  <a href="CC-BY-SA-4.0">CC-BY-SA 4.0</a>.
  Check the source in "view source" in your browser, or the browser
  Developer Tools (in Firefox, use Inspector);
  that will also tell you the library piece filename.
  If you want to edit them you will probably
  want to start with the actual source code,
  because the SVG pieces as sent by the server have generally
  been fed though an SVG distiller.
<p>
  <a href="/_/LICENCE">Further information about licensing</a>
  etc. is available here, and of course also in the source code.
