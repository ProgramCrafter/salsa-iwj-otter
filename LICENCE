Shape libraries
---------------

The shape librariues in library/ are *not* part of otter itself.  The
files there have a variety of different licences, and are often
multiply-licenced.  But all of these files are available under
at least CC-BY-SA 3.0 or CC-BY-SA 4.0, so:

The shape libraries are licensed under either the Creative Commons
Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported License, or the Creative Commons
Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International Licence.
There is NO WARRANTY.

For each file in the shape library, there is a corresponding file
".licence" giving licence, provenance and authorship information.

You can find a copy of the actual licences in the files
CC-BY-SA-3.0.txt and CC-BY-SA-4.0.txt.  If not, see
<https://creativecommons.org/>.


Formalities
-----------

Individual files generally contain the following tag (or similar)
in the copyright notice, instead of the full licence grant text:
  SPDX-License-Identifier: AGPL-3.0-or-later
As is conventional, this should be read as a licence grant.

Contributions to otter are accepted based on the git commit
Signed-off-by convention, by which the contributors' certify their
contributions according to the Developer Certificate of Origin version
1.1 - see the file DEVELOPER-CERTIFICATE.

If you create a new file please be sure to add an appropriate licence
header, probably something like this:
// Copyright by contributors to the otter game system
// SPDX-License-Identifier: AGPL-3.0-or-later
// There is NO WARRANTY.


Partial dual licence
--------------------

Some individual files are dual-licenced and say
  "MIT-0 OR AGPL-3.0-or-later"
Those files are available under the MIT-0 permissive licence when
taken separately, but when distributed as part of otter, they are
AGPLv3+.
