You can download the complete source code of a running instance of
Otter, by visiting the path /src.  There should be a link at the
bottom of the page.

For a list of the contributors to Otter and its provided shape
libraries, see the git history (and the in-source-tree information
from applicable original image sources).  Information about the
contributors to the dependencies is to be found in each dependency's
source code.


Shape libraries
---------------

The shape librariues in library/ are *not* part of Otter itself.  The
files there have a variety of different licences, and are often
multiply-licenced.  But all of these files are available under
at least CC-BY-SA 3.0, CC-BY-SA 4.0 or AGPLv3+, so:

The shape libraries are licensed under either the Creative Commons
Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported License, or the Creative Commons
Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International Licence, or the GNU Affero
General Public License (version 3 or at your option any later
version).  There is NO WARRANTY

Many of these files were downloaded from public sources using the
./media-scraper script; if they are to be edited, it would be best to
edit them at the public source.

For each file in the shape library, there is either a corresponding
file ".licence" (in the git source tree), or a file LICENCE in the
relevant directory, giving licence, provenance and authorship
information.

The individual shapes must be sent by the server to the client as part
of HTML/XML documents and as part of the client/server protocol; they
become part of the dynamic HTML in the page in the client web browser.

These versions of the files have been processed by usvg and are saved
as ".usvg" in the built version of the overall git tree.  The spdx
licence identifier and the provenance of the file is recorded in an
XML comment like this <!-- $SPDX $LIBNAME/$BASENAME --> where $SPDX is
the SPDX licence identifier for the primary licence we are using; and
the $LIBNAME/$BASENAME are relative to the library/ directory in the
source tree, where the full authorship and licence information, and
source url etc., can be found.

You can find a copy of the actual licences in the files
  CC-BY-SA-3.0.txt  CC-BY-SA-4.0.txt  AGPL
If not, see <https://creativecommons.org/> or
<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.


Formalities
-----------

Individual files generally contain the following tag (or similar)
in the copyright notice, instead of the full licence grant text:
  SPDX-License-Identifier: AGPL-3.0-or-later
As is conventional, this should be read as a licence grant.

Contributions to Otter are accepted based on the git commit
Signed-off-by convention, by which the contributors' certify their
contributions according to the Developer Certificate of Origin version
1.1 - see the file DEVELOPER-CERTIFICATE.

If you create a new file please be sure to add an appropriate licence
header, probably something like this:
// Copyright by contributors to the Otter game system
// SPDX-License-Identifier: AGPL-3.0-or-later
// There is NO WARRANTY.


Partial dual licence
--------------------

Some individual files are dual-licenced and say
  "MIT-0 OR AGPL-3.0-or-later"
Those files are available under the MIT-0 permissive licence when
taken separately, but when distributed as part of Otter, they are
AGPLv3+.

The imported git subtree webassembly-types/ is by 01Alchemist and is
available under the MIT licence (SPDX "MIT").  Again, when distributed
as part of Otter, this is AGPLv3+.
