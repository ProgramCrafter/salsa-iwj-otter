The lib target `.*` in package `.*` has the same output filename as the lib target `.*` in package `.*`.
Colliding filename is:.*
The targets should have unique names.
This is a known bug where multiple crates with the same name use
the same path; see <https://github\.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/6313>\.
warning: output filename collision\.
