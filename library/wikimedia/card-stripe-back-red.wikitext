Playing card in SVG based on the french representation. This is a red alternate.

Original version (blue): [[:file:Card_back_03.svg|Card_back_03.svg]]; alternate versions: (red) [[:file:Card_back_03a.svg|Card_back_03a.svg]]; reversed stripe (right to left) (blue) [[:file:Card_back_03b.svg|Card_back_03b.svg]]; (red) [[:file:Card_back_03c.svg|Card_back_03c.svg]]; 

This card has been made with GNOME games in mind and has been succesfully tested with Nautilus, Eye of Gnome (both of them use librsvg) and Inkscape.
